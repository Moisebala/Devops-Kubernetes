Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

Alternatively, if you are the root user, you can run:

  export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

You can now join any number of the control-plane node running the following command on each as root:

  kubeadm join 192.168.200.20:6443 --token 2hgii7.qhr2pgabcnlwc7fr \
	--discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:2f2dc1f9cbb3d32b33e6d43dea8de87a723a43a1bcf6e5566863793f95534789 \
	--control-plane --certificate-key 6de5ee2c11753eb8c90e3fcb73d109778f28d382be8dcce1b253c969e56bb938

Please note that the certificate-key gives access to cluster sensitive data, keep it secret!
As a safeguard, uploaded-certs will be deleted in two hours; If necessary, you can use
"kubeadm init phase upload-certs --upload-certs" to reload certs afterward.

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

kubeadm join 192.168.200.20:6443 --token 2hgii7.qhr2pgabcnlwc7fr \
	--discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:2f2dc1f9cbb3d32b33e6d43dea8de87a723a43a1bcf6e5566863793f95534789
